				<h2>Starting out</h2>
				<div id="whatshaders">
					<h3>So what are those shader thingies, anyway?</h3>
					<p>
					A shader is just a program running on your graphics card, which enables it to run very fast (depending on your hardware).
					There are many different kinds of shaders, but that isn't really important for our purposes at the moment.
					Everything you're going to write on shaderwall is called a <em>fragment shader</em>.
					</p>
					<p>
					Fragment shaders, also known as pixel shaders, are (in short) executed for every pixel of the output, so we're just going to write a small program that calculates a color for each pixel.
					To make it look interesting the color should of course depend on the pixel's position and maybe also on time.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="firstshader">
					<h3>My first fragment shader</h3>
					<p>
					Shaders are written in a programming language called GLSL, which is a bit like C, except it has no pointers but some nice other built-in data types and functions.
					Let's write a quick 'Hello World'-style shader!
					By the way: you can try out all the examples by just pasting them in the shaderwall editor.
					</p>
					<pre>// ignore those first three lines
#ifdef GL_ES
precision mediump float;
#endif

// declare inputs to our shader
uniform float time;
uniform vec2 resolution;

// main function for our shader
void main(void)
{
	// calculate the current pixel position
	// it's in the [0, 1] range, starting bottom left
	vec2 position = gl_FragCoord.xy / resolution;

	// calculate output color
	// colors are represented in the [0, 1] range
	vec3 color = vec3(position.xy, sin(time) * 0.5 + 0.5);

	// write output color in rgba format
	gl_FragColor = vec4(color.rgb, 1.0);
}</pre>
					<p>
					So as you can see, it pretty much looks like C (or any language using C syntax).
					At first we are declaring some <code>uniform</code> variables.
					These are set by the host program, so shaderwall in our case, and have the same value for all pixels.
					<code>time</code> contains the time in seconds since loading the shader and <code>resolution</code> is a two-dimensional vector (<code>vec2</code>) containing width and height of the output.
					</p>
					<p>
					Next, the main function is declared, which is the entry point for your shader.
					In this function, we divide a special value <code>gl_FragCoord.xy</code> by the resolution.
					Variables prefixed with <code>gl_</code> are special variables set by OpenGL, in this case it contains the respective pixel position.
					For now, just ignore the <code>.xy</code> part, it's a nice little thing called <em>swizzling</em> and will be covered later.
					So by dividing these two values, we get a two-dimensional vector with values between 0 and 1.
					</p>
					<p>
					Now, we calculate the color to be displayed. It will be a three dimesional vector, for the colors red, green and blue.
					Colors in OpenGL are represented as floats in the <code>[0, 1]</code> range, not as integers between 0 and 255.
					As you will find out when writing your first shaders that's a lot more convenient (also you graphics card loves floats!).
					The color gets set to a <code>vec3</code> consisting of <code>position.xy</code> and some calculations with <code>sin(time)</code>.
					Because <code>position</code> is a two-dimensional vector, it is assigned to the first two components of the output color.
					So red gets the value of the current x coordinate and green the one of the y coordinate.
					To the remaining blue component we assign <code>sin(time) * 0.5 + 0.5</code>, which is just a sine applied to the <code>time</code> input with some rescaling to stay in the <code>[0, 1]</code> range.
					</p>
					<p>
					At last, we're assigning a value to <code>gl_FragColor</code>, which is another special variable for our output color.
					It's a four-dimensional vector, but we only care about the first three components.
					These are the three color channels for red, green and blue.
					Because <code>color</code> is a three-dimensional vector, it is assigned to the first three components of the fragment color.
					To the remaining forth component, the alpha channel, we assign just <code>1.0</code>, which is needed to assure the color is fully opaque.
					</p>

					<p>
					So just copy and paste the code into the shaderwall editor and look at the result.
					It should give you some gradient with a changing amount of blue color.
					Not verry pretty, but it's a start!

				<h2>Basic GLSL</h2>
				<div id="data">
					<h3>Data types</h3>
					<p>
					Aside from the usual <code>float</code> and <code>int</code> types, GLSL also has some more advanced data types for vectors and matrices.
					<p>
					There are vectors of up to four dimensions called <code>vec2</code>, <code>vec3</code> and <code>vec4</code>.
					To construct a new vector just use the matching function: <code>vec3(1.0, 0.0, 1.0)</code>.
					You can also create a vector by supplying only one value for all components: <code>vec3(1.0)</code>.
					Another way of constructing vectors is by using smaller vectors: <code>vec3(some_vec2, 1.0)</code>.
					This will use the first two components of <code>some_vec2</code> as the first two components of the resulting <code>vec3</code> and the <code>1.0</code> as the third component.
					</p>
					<p>
					You can do arithmetic on vectors just like on numbers.
					Most operations like <code>+</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, â€¦ just work component-wise.
					You can also do scalar-vector operations, e.g. multiply a <code>vec4</code> by a <code>float</code> value.
					Additionally, there are some functions defined on vectors, like <code>length(v)</code>, <code>normalize(v)</code>, <code>dot(a, b)</code> and <code>cross(a, b)</code>.
					</p>
					<p>
					The elements of a vector can be accessed in several different ways.
					First of all, there is array syntax: <code>v[2]</code>.
					This will return the third component of the vector <code>v</code> (indexes start at zero).
					Alternatively, the following syntax will do the same thing: <code>v.z</code>.
					There are several ways of naming the components of a vector: <code>xyzw</code>, <code>rgba</code> and <code>stpq</code>.
					</p>
					<p>
					Matrices will not be covered, but are also very simple to use.
					The most important part to remember is that matrices are column-major and how to do a rotation.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="swizzling">
					<h3>Swizzling</h3>
					<p>
					So we just learned how you can access the individual components of a vector.
					But why should you be limited to only one component?
					It sure would be nice if could get multiple components as another vector.
					The simple but useful technique allowing you to do this is called <b>swizzling</b>.
					</p>
					<p>
					So suppose you have a vector like this: <code>vec4 v = vec4(0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0);</code>.
					You can create a <code>vec2</code> containing only the first two components from this just like this: <code>vec2 u = v.xy;</code>.
					Or maybe you just want the last two?
					Just do <code>vec2 u = v.zw;</code>.
					Some more examples:
					</p>
					<pre>vec4 v = vec4(0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0);
vec4 v_reversed = v.wzyx; // you can change the order of the components
vec3 u = v.yxx; // or reuse components
float l = length(v.yxw); // in every context</pre>
				</div>
				<div id="control">
					<h3>Control structures</h3>
					<p>
					You can have <code>while</code> and <code>for</code> loops and <code>if-else</code>-statements like in C (and most other languages), so they aren't very interesting.
					</p>
					<pre>// some stupid loops
float foo = 1.0;
while (foo &gt; 1e-3) {
	foo /= 3.0;
}

float bar = 0.0;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
	bar += float(i);
}

float baz;
if (bar &lt; 4.0) {
	baz = 1.0;
} else {
	baz = 2.0;
}</pre>
					<p>
					Functions work a bit differently in GLSL, because there is no stack.
					This means you can't use recursion, i.e. call a function from itself or from a function called by the function.
					Also, because there are no pointers, there is a thing called <code>out</code> and <code>inout</code> parameters.
					</p>
					<pre>float someFunction(vec2 foo, out float bar) {
	// output the second component to bar
	bar = foo.y;
	// return the first component
	return foo.x;
}

float someOtherFunction(inout float foo) {
	// you are not allowed to access the value of a 'out' parameter
	// so there is 'inout', which can be used for input as well as output
	foo += 5.0;
	return foo + 3.0;
}

void main() {
	// you call someFunction() like this
	float b;
	float a = someFunction(vec2(1.0, 2.0), b);
	// a is now 1.0, b is 2.0
	a = someOtherFunction(b);
	// a is now 10.0, b is 7.0
}</pre>
				</div>

				<h2>Useful functions</h2>
				<div id="mix">
					<h3>Mix</h3>
					<p>
					<code>mix(a, b, t)</code> provides linear interpolation, i.e. it is equivalent to <code>a * t + b * (t - 1.0)</code>.
					This can better be visualized by connecting two points with a straigt line like this.
					</p>
					<img src="/lib/img/mix.png" />
					<p>
					<code>mix</code> can also be used on vectors, of course, with the third argument being either a vector or a scalar.
					Because linear interpolation is such a common operation in computer graphics, this is often of use.
					There are geometric applications, like if you like to describe a line through two points, but you can also use it to combine colors and nearly everything you could think of.
					</p>
					<p>
					Another common thing is to plug in another function into the third argument for shaping the control parameter.
					This is great if you'd like to avoid for your interpolation to look too linear.
					Try different functions, like <code>pow</code>, <code>exp</code> or <code>smoothstep</code>.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="step">
					<h3>Step</h3>
					<p>
					<code>step(edge, x)</code> is a simple function which has value 0 when <code>edge < x</code> and is 1 otherwise.
					It is often simpler to mulitply with step than to use an explicit <code>if</code>.
					You can think of <code>step</code> as a comparison operation with a implicit cast to float (if your mind works very C-ish).
					</p>
					<img src="/lib/img/step.png" />
				</div>
				<div id="smoothstep">
					<h3>Smoothstep</h3>
					<p>
					<code>smoothstep(edge0, edge1, x)</code> works like <code>step</code>, except it takes two edge arguments.
					For <code>x</code> below <code>edge0</code> and above <code>edge1</code> it is 0 and 1, respectively.
					The interesting part is between those two values, where the function interpolates smoothly between 0 and 1.
					</p>
					<img src="/lib/img/smoothstep.png" />
					<p>
					So <code>smoothstep</code> can be used as a differentiable alternative to <code>step</code>, which is sometimes useful, but usually it just looks better.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="clamp">
					<h3>Clamp</h3>
					<p>
					<code>clamp(x, minVal, maxVal)</code> can be used to limit a value to a specific range.
					It is equivalent to <code>min(max(x, minVal), maxVal)</code>.
					</p>
					<img src="/lib/img/clamp.png" />
				</div>
				<div id="other">
					<h3>Other functions</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><code>sin(x)</code>, <code>cos(x)</code>, <code>tan(x)</code>, <code>asin(x)</code>, <code>acos(x)</code>, <code>atan(x)</code>, <code>atan(y, x)</code>
						<li><code>min(a, b)</code> and <code>max(a, b)</code></li>
						<li><code>abs(x)</code></li>
						<li><code>floor(x)</code>, <code>ceil(x)</code>, <code>truncate(x)</code></li>
						<li><code>exp(x)</code>, <code>pow(a, b)</code></li>
						<li><code>mod(a, b)</code></li>
					</ul>
