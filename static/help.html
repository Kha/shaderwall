					<h3>So what are those shader thingies, anyway?</h3>
					<p>
					A shader is just a program running on your graphics card, which enables it to run very fast (depending on your hardware).
					There are many different kinds of shaders, but that isn't really important for our purposes at the moment.
					Everything you're going to write on shaderwall is called a <b>fragment shader</b>.
					</p>
					<p>
					Fragment shaders, also known as pixel shaders, are (in short) executed for every pixel of the output, so we're just going to write a small program that calculates a color for that pixel.
					To make it look interesting the color should of course depend on the pixel's position and maybe also on time.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="firstshader">
					<h3>My first fragment shader</h3>
					<p>
					Shaders are written in a programming language called GLSL, which is a bit like C, except it has no pointers but some nice other builtin data types and functions.
					Let's write a quick 'Hello World'-style shader!
					By the way: you can try out all the examples by just pasting them in the shaderwall editor.
					</p>
					<pre>// ignore those first three lines
#ifdef GL_ES
precision mediump float;
#endif

// declare inputs to our shader
uniform float time;
uniform vec2 resolution;

// main function for our shader
void main(void)
{
	vec2 position = gl_FragCoord.xy / resolution;
	// write output color
	gl_FragColor = vec4(position, sin(time) * 0.5 + 0.5, 1.0);
}</pre>
					<p>
					So as you can see, it pretty much looks like C (or any language using C syntax).
					At first we are declaring some <code>uniform</code> variables.
					These are set by the host program, so shaderwall in our case, and have the same value for all pixels.
					<code>time</code> contains the time in seconds since loading the shader and <code>resolution</code> is a two-dimensional vector (<code>vec2</code>) containing width and height of the output.
					</p>
					<p>
					Next, the main function is declared, which is the entry point for your shader.
					In this function, we divide a special value <code>gl_FragCoord.xy</code> by the resolution.
					Variables prefixed with <code>gl_</code> are special variables set by OpenGL, in this case it contains the respective pixel position.
					For now, just ignore the <code>.xy</code> part, it's a nice little thing called <b>swizzling</b> and will be covered later.
					So by dividing these two values, we get a two-dimensional vector with values between 0 and 1.
					</p>
					<p>
					At last, we're assigning a value to <code>gl_FragColor</code>, which is another special variable for our output color.
					It's a four-dimensional vector, but we only care about the first three components.
					These are the three color channels for red, green and blue.
					Because <code>position</code> is a two-dimensional vector, it is assigned to the first two components of the output color.
					To the remaining blue component we assign <code>sin(time) * 0.5 + 0.5</code>, which is just a sine applied to the <code>time</code> input with some rescaling to stay in the <code>[0, 1]</code> range.
					</p>
					<p>
					So just copy and paste the code into the shaderwall editor and look at the result.
					It should give you some gradient with a changing amount of blue color.
					Not verry pretty, but it's a start!

				<h2>Basic GLSL</h2>
				<div id="data">
					<h3>Data types</h3>
					<p>
					Aside from the usual <code>float</code> and <code>int</code> types, GLSL also has some more advanced data types for vectors and matrices.
					<p>
					There are vectors of up to four dimensions called <code>vec2</code>, <code>vec3</code> and <code>vec4</code>.
					To construct a new vector just use the matching function: <code>vec3(1.0, 0.0, 1.0)</code>.
					You can also create a vector by supplying only one value for all components: <code>vec3(1.0)</code>.
					Another way of constructing vectors is by using smaller vectors: <code>vec3(some_vec2, 1.0)</code>.
					This will use the first two components of <code>some_vec2</code> as the first two components of the resulting <code>vec3</code> and the <code>1.0</code> as the third component.
					</p>
					<p>
					You can do arithmetic on vectors just like on numbers.
					Most operations like <code>+</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, … just work component-wise.
					You can also do scalar-vector operations, e.g. multiply a <code>vec4</code> by a <code>float</code> value.
					Additionally, there are some functions defined on vectors, like <code>length(v)</code>, <code>normalize(v)</code>, <code>dot(a, b)</code> and <code>cross(a, b)</code>.
					</p>
					<p>
					The elements of a vector can be accessed in several different ways.
					First of all, there is array syntax: <code>v[2]</code>.
					This will return the third component of the vector <code>v</code> (indexes start at zero).
					Alternatively, the following syntax will do the same thing: <code>v.z</code>.
					There are several ways of naming the components of a vector: <code>xyzw</code>, <code>rgba</code> and <code>stpq</code>.
					</p>
					<p>
					Maybe some matrix stuff… TODO
